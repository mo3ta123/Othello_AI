## Introduction
Othello is a two-player abstract strategy game played on a board with 8 rows and 8 columns and a set of 64 identical pieces. The pieces are usually discs with a bright and a dark face, with each colour representing one of the players. Players take turns making a "move," which consists of placing one disc with their assigned colour facing up on the board and then flipping over all of the opponent's discs that are "outflanked" by the disc that was just placed.  The goal of the game is to have the majority of one's own coloured pieces visible at the conclusion.
